With 80,000 pounds of cargo, it can make the same run in just 20 seconds. It can charge up to 400 miles in just 30 minutes when using a Megacharger, which is a new high-speed charger.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle is minimalistic and designed around the comfort of the driver. The driver position is placed in the center of the vehicle, instead of on the left side. This helps provide greater visibility to the driver, Musk said. The cabin is also spacious enough for the driver to stand.\n\nTesla will begin production of the vehicle in 2019. The company is currently taking reservations for the semi, but a deposit will set buyers back $5,000.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/",4,6,140,428,18,1420833.0

There are 3.5 million professional drivers in the US, all of whom may face job displacement in the autonomous future being developed by companies like Otto, Daimler, and Tesla. But before robots take the wheel entirely, there will be a long period where truckers and artificial technology split the responsibilities of the work. The first big step toward that future comes in the form of the electronic logging device, a dashboard monitor that tracks speed, location, and a driver's schedule, and reports it to an employer or a third-party monitoring service. It has a lot of truckers worried. \n\nRead Karen Levy's work here: \nhttps://goo.gl/XHYuvv \nhttps://goo.gl/BVJWmY\n\nRead the FMCSA's report on ELD safety:\nhttps://goo.gl/ydYx1R\n\nRead the NAS report on driving fatigue:\nhttps://goo.gl/VJVZMa\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

That’s thanks to a design concept called “shared space,” where urban planners drastically lessen the presence of traffic lights, signs, and barriers, encouraging all forms of transportation to share the road.  There’s evidence that drivers often totally ignore road signs, so the heightened risk forces commuters to remain on high alert as they pass through an intersection, in theory leading to safer travel. But by stripping cities of their traditional traffic control systems, they leave disabled residents in the dark — and that’s sparked a powerful debate of how to balance ease of movement with all residents’ needs. \n\nThis is one of a series of videos we're launching in partnership with 99% Invisible, an awesome podcast about design. 99% Invisible is a member of Radiotopia.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The invisible box challenge went viral this week, thanks to a successful attempt by a Texan high school cheerleader. It’s basic mime, but it’s impressive enough to have inspired thousands of less agile challengers to share their attempts online.

Just before the game, my cheer team recalled the original video on Twitter and we decided to try it out. We all started trying it and I only did it a few times and supposedly it was pretty good. We decided to record it for the fun of it so I posted it on my snapchat story. The idea of the 'part two' came from my teammate where she 'kicked the box' out from under me.\n\nWATCH VIRALHOG VIDEOS EVERY DAY:\n\nSubscribe to us on YouTube: https://goo.gl/A0gBKk\nLike us on Facebook: https://goo.gl/XQWqJt\nFollow us on Instagram: https://goo.gl/NMq8dl\nFollow us on Twitter: https://goo.gl/pF8Xop\n\nSubmit your own great video and make money: https://goo.gl/yejGkm\n\nContact licensing@viralhog.com to license this or any ViralHog video.",4,7,488,1124,19,282774.0

Owners want stadiums.\n\nWatch how NFL rule changes made linemen gigantic: http://bit.ly/2BSOf5n\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIn the past 20 years, over $7 billion in public money has gone towards financing the construction and renovation of NFL football stadiums. Owners argue that public investment in private football franchises will bring a boom of economic activity to  local economies. But this argument doesn’t hold up. In reality, stadiums and their upkeep wind up costing cities millions of dollars. \n\nFor owners, new stadiums mean more profits. They get to host the Super Bowl, sell naming rights to other corporations, and build increasingly opulent and expensive premium seating.\n\nFor cities, nabbing an itinerant football franchise looking for a new home field can be a big political win. And residents want teams and the hometown pride that comes with it. Football teams give cities a sense of identity and they are paying more than ever for them.\n\nNew stadiums aren’t the economic powerhouses owners promise they’ll be. But as long there are more cities that want a home team than there are franchises, it looks like taxpayers are going to keep footing the bill.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Like a dome or arch, the support comes from the sides rather than the top, and the water underneath prevents the ice from breaking. But, experience and careful advance planning are key. Factors including temperature, atmospheric conditions, and even satellite images of the Earth’s surface are considered. It’s complicated, but appealing to mathematicians like Ajne. Even with preparation, there’s a risk of falling in… So it’s best done in groups, for safety.\n\nRead about the science behind Nordic skating in How Skating on Thin Ice Creates Laser-Like Sounds\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/activities/winter-sports/skating-thin-black-ice-creates-sound-nordic-spd/\n\nHear the Otherworldly Sounds of Skating on Thin Ice | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/v3O9vNi-dkA\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo",2,4,140,631,33,7552015.0

The figure skating jump is legendary among ice skaters, from Tonya Harding's 1991 triple axel to modern icon Mirai Nagasu's attempts in competition. It turns out that the physics of the triple axel makes it a uniquely difficult jump — and one worth learning about.\n\nAs a forward-edge jump, the mechanics of a triple axel requires technical acumen from skaters while they still try to maintain an artistically interesting performance. Pioneers like Midori Ito and Tonya Harding had to jump, ramp up rotation speed, and then land all while trying to look good. This effort set them apart from competitors like Nancy Kerrigan, but it wasn't easy to land a triple axel in competition.\n\nAnd that difficulty might be why the triple axel endures as the pinnacle of figure skating performance — and why it's sure to light up the 2018 Winter Olympics as well.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
