\n
\nJames Ambler and Keith Glickman, 37 and 29, from New York, USA, created RokShok the world’s first mobile phone case that conceals an engagement ring.
\n
\nPositioning the ring right in front of the camera, it allows users to record and even live stream their proposal and the reaction to friends and family all over the world. 
\n
\nThe pair say RokShok, available for $39.95 (31GBP), will help couples captures one of the ‘happiest moments of their lives’ and claim their slimline product is subtler than a traditional, bulky ring-box.\n\n**To use or license this video please contact Licensing@catersnews.com**

Nobody has time for that and they’re like a buck or two\nTake a 13.5oz/398ml can of pure pumpkin. Not “pumpkin pie filling.” Don’t be an animal\nBut that in a bowl. It’s gonna be thick. Be prepared for that\nAdd two eggs\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \n(or if you’re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\nWangjangle that together until it’s smooth. \nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \nReduce it to 350. \nNow here’s where you’re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow.",7,7,488,1335,15,1115811.0

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \n\n “Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), and Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”). \n\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \n\n“Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), editor Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”\nThe “Rampage” creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (“San Andreas,” “X-Men: Apocalypse”), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).\n\n“Rampage” opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.\nA New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, “Rampage” will be distributed by Warner Bros.

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official webshop - https://simonscat.theofficialwebshop.com/",5,5,488,1360,44,4673210.0

Many people recognize Technicolor from The Wizard of Oz, but the technology existed long before then. Two strip Technicolor and three strip Technicolor both revolutionized the film industry and shaped the look of 20th century film.\n\nBut Technicolor also influenced movies through its corporate control of the technology. People like Natalie Kalmus shaped the aesthetic of color films, and directors redesigned their sets and films based on the Technicolor look that the company — and viewers — demanded.\n\nThough the process we traditionally recognize as Technicolor is no longer in use (the company does continue), the look remains influential even today.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

By February 28, Scooby was tearing down the tide at 45 miles an hour on his rattling surfboard. There was a 70-foot mountain of water avalanching behind him.\n\nThe seething spume nipped him from behind and sent him bombing into the fray in a violent back flop.\n\nScooby’s friend and fellow Brazilian, Lucas Chumbo Chianca, rode in on a jet ski to pick him up before the next monster set rolled in. Scooby grabbed ahold of a rear tow board latched to the jet ski, and they sped away in an attempt to outrun the next wave. Chumbo soon lost control in the choppy whitewater, and the jet ski capsized near some dangerous rocks. Another massive wave was right behind them. \nTwo people now needed a rescue. \nHow did Scooby and Chumbo finally escape the chaos? Everaldo Pato Teixeira, a veteran big wave surfer from Brazil, tore in on yet another jet ski. In a deft and coolheaded rescue bolstered by years of experience, Teixeira rescued Chumbo and Scooby, both of whom were relatively unscathed.\n\nThis episode ended well and became one of the main highlights of the Big Wave Season, the drone video went viral after it was used on a Red Bull Production and later licensed to National Geographic, reaching 20 million views in few days, dozens of media outlets picked up the story, the footage is currently being licensed for several feature documentaries across the globe, and is now perhaps the most viewed piece of footage of Nazaré.\n\n** The Big Ugly was an Official Nominee for the Los Angeles Drone Film Festival 2017 edition, featured on VICE/Motherboard.\n\n*** UPDATE (Dec 3, 2017): The Big Ugly is the Winner of the News & Documentary Award on the #LADFF Los Angeles Drone Film Festival 2017 edition\n----------\n\nCopyright © 2017, Máquina Voadora, all rights reserved\nFilmed and Edited by: Máquina Voadora\nFeatured Surfers: Pedro Scooby, Lucas Chumbo, Everaldo Pato Teixeira\nMusic: Drive by Ross Bugden (https://youtu.be/3pZdZiPnsGs) \nLocation: Praia do Norte, Nazaré - Portugal\n__________________________\nThe footage in this video is protected by copyright.

Thankfully the surgery was a success and Jimmy returned to the show tonight with Billy in tow to show everyone how well he is doing. Jimmy thanks the bright and talented doctors and nurses at Children’s Hospital LA. He has to have one more surgery when he is around six years old and then he is good to go. However, the fight is not over for millions of children whose health is threatened right now because a program called CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program), that is there to protect them, is in serious need of funding because Congress recently failed to approve funding for it. This is not a partisan issue. Democrats and Republicans have always overwhelmingly supported it – until now. Now it’s being used as a bargaining chip. So Jimmy is encouraging everyone to call the House and Senate at (202) 225-3121 to tell them to take a break from tax cuts and fully fund CHIP now. Also, if you don’t have health insurance make sure to go to healthcare.gov and sign up before the December 15th deadline. #FundCHIPNow\n\nMelissa McCarthy vs. Jennifer Aniston – The Great Gravity Debate https://youtu.be/ncHhjUllA7s\n \nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest #KIMMEL: http://bit.ly/JKLSubscribe\n \nWatch Mean Tweets: http://bit.ly/KimmelMT10\n \nConnect with Jimmy Kimmel Live Online:\n \nVisit the Jimmy Kimmel Live WEBSITE: http://bit.ly/JKLWebsite\nLike Jimmy Kimmel on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/KimmelFB\nLike Jimmy Kimmel Live on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/JKLFacebook\nFollow @JimmyKimmel on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/KimmelTW\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/JKLTwitter\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on INSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/JKLInstagram\n \nAbout Jimmy Kimmel Live:\n \nJimmy Kimmel serves as host and executive producer of Emmy-winning Jimmy Kimmel Live, ABC's late-night talk show.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live is well known for its huge viral video successes with 5.6 billion views on YouTube alone.\nSome of Kimmel's most popular comedy bits include - Mean Tweets, Lie Witness News, Jimmy's Twerk Fail Prank, Unnecessary Censorship, YouTube Challenge, The Baby Bachelor, Movie: The Movie, Handsome Men's Club, Jimmy Kimmel Lie Detective and music videos like I (Wanna) Channing All Over Your Tatum and a Blurred Lines parody with Robin Thicke, Pharrell, Jimmy and his security guard Guillermo.\nNow in its fifteenth season, Kimmel's guests have included: Johnny Depp, Meryl Streep, Tom Cruise, Halle Berry, Harrison Ford, Jennifer Aniston, Will Ferrell, Katy Perry, Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, George Clooney, Larry David, Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Kobe Bryant, Steve Carell, Hugh Jackman, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Bridges, Jennifer Garner, Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston, Jamie Foxx, Amy Poehler, Ben Affleck, Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, Oprah, and unfortunately Matt Damon.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Returns with Baby Billy After Heart Surgery\nhttps://youtu.be/yqulWPljawo",2,1,488,1712,28,11259007.0

The film follows the course of the friends’ lives, from the struggles of childhood through finding their footing in life, to the series of unlikely events leading up to the attack.  Throughout the harrowing ordeal, their friendship never wavers, making it their greatest weapon and allowing them to save the lives of the more than 500 passengers on board.\n\nThe heroic trio is comprised of Anthony Sadler, Oregon National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, and U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, who play themselves in the film.  Starring alongside them are Jenna Fischer (“Hall Pass,” TV’s “The Office”); Judy Greer (“War for the Planet of the Apes”); Ray Corasani (TV’s upcoming “The Long Road Home”); PJ Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”); Tony Hale (TV’s “Veep”); and Thomas Lennon (“Transformers: Age of Extinction”).  Paul-Mikél Williams plays the younger Anthony, Bryce Gheisar plays the younger Alek, and William Jennings plays the younger Spencer.\n\nEastwood (“Sully,” “American Sniper”) directs from a screenplay by Dorothy Blyskal, based on the book by Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, Spencer Stone and Jeffrey E. Stern.  Eastwood also produces the film, along with Tim Moore, Kristina Rivera and Jessica Meier.  The film’s executive producer is Bruce Berman.\n\nBehind the scenes, the creative team includes frequent collaborators Tom Stern, who served as cinematographer on 13 of Eastwood’s previous films, and Deborah Hopper, who has served as Eastwood’s costume designer on 17 prior films; editor Blu Murray, who most recently cut “Sully,” and that film’s composer, Christian Jacob.  Veteran art director Kevin Ishioka, whose work can be seen in “Sully” and in “Dunkirk,” serves as production designer.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Malpaso production, “The 15:17 to Paris.”  The film will be released in theaters on February 9, 2018.  It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.",5,5,11,42,20,5029965.0

Not only were they gathering dust, the film material itself was slowly decomposing, bringing the data they contained to the brink of being lost forever.\n \nFor the past five years, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) weapon physicist Greg Spriggs and a crack team of film experts, archivists and software developers have been on a mission to hunt down, scan, reanalyze and declassify these decomposing films. The goals are to preserve the films’ content before it’s lost forever, and provide better data to the post-testing-era scientists who use computer codes to help certify that the aging U.S. nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure and effective.\n \nRead more: https://www.llnl.gov/news/physicist-declassifies-rescued-nuclear-test-films\n\nLLNL Copyright and Reuse Policy: https://www.llnl.gov/copyright-and-reuse\n\nSee the declassified LLNL tests: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...",1,3,140,194,10,36302.0

Gigantic moving cities now roam the Earth, ruthlessly preying upon smaller traction towns.  Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan)—who hails from a Lower Tier of the great traction city of London—finds himself fighting for his own survival after he encounters the dangerous fugitive Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar).  Two opposites, whose paths should never have crossed, forge an unlikely alliance that is destined to change the course of the future.  \n\nMortal Engines is the startling, new epic adventure directed by Oscar®-winning visual-effects artist Christian Rivers (King Kong).  Joining Rivers are The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogies three-time Academy Award®-winning filmmakers Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, who have penned the screenplay.  The Universal and MRC adaptation is from the award-winning book series by Philip Reeve, published in 2001 by Scholastic.  \n\nOn board as producers are Zane Weiner (The Hobbit trilogy), Amanda Walker (The Hobbit trilogy) and Deborah Forte (Goosebumps), as well as Walsh and Jackson.  Ken Kamins (The Hobbit trilogy) joins Boyens as executive producer.  Universal will distribute the film worldwide.  www.mortalengines.com",3,3,151,174,20,1446544.0

Crossing the line from law-abiding citizen to wanted criminal, Harold battles to survive his increasingly dangerous situation in ways that raise the question: Is he out of his depth — or two steps ahead?\n\n#GringoMovie\n\n» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/AmazonVideoSubscribe\n» In Theaters March 9\n\nAbout Gringo:\nMild-mannered pharmaceutical company executive Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) takes a business trip from Chicago to Mexico with his cutthroat bosses Richard (Joel Edgerton) and Elaine (Charlize Theron). At the company’s Mexican lab, Richard orders manager Sanchez (Hernán Mendoza) to stop selling the bioengineered marijuana product Cannabax to a brutal, Beatles-loving cartel kingpin known as The Black Panther. Meanwhile, straight-arrow Harold learns he’ll be out of a job as soon as Richard and Elaine sell their newly cleaned-up company to a conglomerate. And when he turns to his wife Bonnie (Thandie Newton) back home for comfort, she confesses via Skype that she’s having an affair.\n\nTargeted by the ruthless Black Panther, who hopes to gain access to the Cannabax formula, Harold disappears before his bosses return to Chicago. A few hours later they receive a call informing them he’s been kidnapped, and his captors are demanding a $5 million ransom. Rather than pay, Richard dispatches his mercenary-turned-humanitarian brother Mitch (Sharlto Copley) to extract Harold. But even with some temporary assistance from warmhearted American tourist Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her drug-mule boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway), Harold’s prospects for survival grow dimmer by the minute.\n\nPursued by an army of attackers, Harold crosses the line from mild-mannered citizen to wanted criminal. But is he out of his depth? Or two steps ahead? An action-comedy roller-coaster ride brimming with black humor, white-knuckle car chases and double-dealing, Gringo takes the concept of adventure travel to a whole new level.\nDirected by Nash Edgerton, who made his feature-length directorial debut with the acclaimed Australian thriller The Square, Gringo is written by Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone and produced by Rebecca Yeldham, Nash Edgerton, Beth Kono, A.J.

When his glamorous mother (Bette Midler) is forced to send him to live with his straight-laced father (Larry Pine), Billy finds himself a diva-out-of-water at his new ultra-conservative high school. Undaunted by the bullies who don’t understand him, the fearless Billy sets out to make a big statement in his own inimitable way: challenging the school’s reigning mean girl (Abigail Breslin) for the title of homecoming queen. This proudly offbeat comedy is an irresistible ode to outsiders and nonconformists of all stripes. \n\n#IFCFilms #Freakshow\n\nSubscribe to IFC: http://youtube.com/user/IFCFilmsTube\n\nConnect with IFC Online\nIFC Films Official Site: http://www.ifcfilms.com\nFollow IFC Films on Twitter: http://twitter.com/IFCFilms\nFind IFC Films on Facebook: http://facebook.com/IFCFilmsOfficial\nFollow IFC Films on Instagram : http://instagram.com/ifcfilms",11,12,441,695,40,63986.0

The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven’t seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It’s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they’ve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it’s about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes. Home Depot has a separate section for dark sky friendly lighting. Then, look for bright unshielded lights on nearby streets, parking lots, etc. Raise awareness on the issue, get help from the IDA to make your city write lighting ordinances. Together, we can fight pollution and have our night skies and our identity back.\n\nContact: srirammurali.com/contact/\nMusic: Imagine by Ryan Taubert\nCopyright All Rights Reserved",9,143,11,25,6,693.0

Sharon Stone stars, along with Garrett Hedlund, Frederick Weller, Beau Bridges, Paul Reubens, Jennifer Ferrin, Devin Ratray, Michael Cerveris, James Ransone, Jeremy Bobb and Maya Kazan.\n\nThree years in the making, the MOSAIC app allows viewers to choose what point-of-view from which to follow the story and to, in effect, build their own experience from the material Soderbergh and Solomon created. The choices one makes build upon one another, enabling multiple tellings of the story from different perspectives and, sometimes, with different conclusions. Viewers will be able to see how their own versions of the story on the app ultimately compare to Soderbergh’s six-part linear narrative in January.\n\nSubscribe to the HBO YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/JQUfqt\n \nDon’t have HBO?

This film follows one such researcher, whose passion leads her to initiate a new technique inspired by a black bear program in rural New Hampshire.  What starts as a cross-culture collaboration becomes a life-changing journey for an American biologist who crosses an ocean to join her; a scientist from Inner Mongolia; and a very curious female cub named Qian Qian, born in captivity. \n\nCaptured with IMAX® Cameras, join Qian Qian on an exciting new adventure in the mountains of Sichuan as she takes her first steps outside her protected habitat, discovering her true animal nature…even as she faces the challenges of the unknown. \n\nDavid Douglas and Drew Fellman, the filmmakers behind “Born to be Wild” and “Island of Lemurs: Madagascar,” directed the film, which Fellman wrote and produced, with Douglas as director of photography.  Donald Kushner and Steve Ransohoff also produced the film, with Li Gen Xiong and Elie Samaha executive producing and Neal Allen serving as line producer. \n\n“Born to be Wild” and “Island of Lemurs: Madagascar” editor Beth Spiegel and composer Mark Mothersbaugh collaborated with Douglas and Fellman once again, with sound design by Gus Koven. \n\nIMAX Entertainment presents, in association with IMAX Documentary Films Capital and Panda Productions, “Pandas.”   The film will be released in select IMAX® and IMAX® 3D theaters starting April 6, 2018.  The film is rated G.",5,6,151,185,6,5029965.0

It doesn't help that his dad is the school's janitor, either, who picks up his son in a rickety old car everyday.\n\nBut George's dad decides to stand up for his kid, showing just how far a parent will go to love and support their child -- even if it means possible further humiliation.\n\nDirector Andrew Mudge has crafted a sweet, delightful dramedy full of genuine heart and compassion. Its charming quirks -- minimal dialogue for the main characters, soaring score and meticulous and witty production design -- never overwhelm the film.\n\nThe Perfect Gooseys wears its sincerity and emotion proudly, earning every second of its touching finale -- and reminding us what really matters when it comes to what teach our families.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nConnect with Omeleto!\n\nFacebook ► http://facebook.com/omeletocom/\nTwitter ► http://twitter.com/omeletocom\nInstagram ► http://instagram.com/omeletocom/\nSnapchat ► http://snapchat.com/add/omeletocom\nNewsletter ► http://omeleto.com/join/\n\n🎬 Got a film?

But when an even more unstoppable threat is unleashed to tear through our cities and bring the world to its knees, he is given one last chance to live up to his father’s legacy by his estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi)—who is leading a brave new generation of pilots that have grown up in the shadow of war. As they seek justice for the fallen, their only hope is to unite together in a global uprising against the forces of extinction. \n\nJake is joined by gifted rival pilot Lambert (The Fate of the Furious’ Scott Eastwood) and 15-year-old Jaeger hacker Amara (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), as the heroes of the PPDC become the only family he has left. Rising up to become the most powerful defense force to ever walk the earth, they will set course for a spectacular all-new adventure on a towering scale. \n\nPacific Rim Uprising is directed by Steven S. DeKnight (Netflix’s Daredevil, STARZ’s Spartacus) and also stars Jing Tian, Burn Gorman, Adria Arjona and Charlie Day. \n\n#JoinTheUprising #PacificRimUprising",7,7,14,40,23,233174.0

In the heart of Bearadise Ranch, Florida, Monica Welde and her son, Johnny IV, spend their days rolling around with bears that weigh up to 1,000lbs. The Welde family have looked after grizzly bears, black bears and polar bears for the last 91 years – using their license to provide for those in need of a home. But the family tradition came under threat last year when Monica’s husband, Johnny III, died of a heart attack just after he turned 60. But with the help of her son, a devastated Monica has put her loss to one side so she can concentrate on continuing the family legacy and caring for their beloved pet bears.\n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Rodrigo Gomez\nProducer: Danny Baggot, Ruby Coote  \nEditor: Sonia Estal \n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit ANIMALS.BARCROFT.TV: http://animals.barcroft.tv/\nLike @BarcroftAnimals on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftAnimals/\nFollow @BarcroftAnimals on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BarcroftAnimals\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/videos\n\nDownload the Barcroft TV iOS app: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&hl=en",5,6,158,502,33,414563.0

In a world ravaged for years by a virus that turns the infected into zombie-like cannibals, a cure is at last found and the wrenching process of reintegrating the survivors back into society begins. Among the formerly afflicted is Senan (Sam Keeley), a young man haunted by the horrific acts he committed while infected. Welcomed back into the family of his widowed sister-in-law (Ellen Page), Senan attempts to restart his life—but is society ready to forgive him and those like him? Or will fear and prejudice once again tear the world apart? Pulsing with provocative parallels to our troubled times, The Cured is a smart, scary, and hauntingly human tale of guilt and redemption\n\nSubscribe to IFC: http://youtube.com/user/IFCFilmsTube\n\nConnect with IFC Online\nIFC Films Official Site: http://www.ifcfilms.com\nFollow IFC Films on Twitter: http://twitter.com/IFCFilms\nFind IFC Films on Facebook: http://facebook.com/IFCFilmsOfficial\nFollow IFC Films on Instagram : http://instagram.com/ifcfilms",3,4,59,217,33,63986.0

Next Independence Day, witness the rise of our country’s 12 hours of annual lawlessness.  Welcome to the movement that began as a simple experiment: The First Purge.\n \nTo push the crime rate below one percent for the rest of the year, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) test a sociological theory that vents aggression for one night in one isolated community.  But when the violence of oppressors meets the rage of the marginalized, the contagion will explode from the trial-city borders and spread across the nation.\n\nComing off the most successful film in the series, The Purge: Election Year, creator James DeMonaco (writer/director of The Purge, The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year) returns alongside the producers of this worldwide phenomenon: Blumhouse Productions’ Jason Blum (Insidious series, Get Out, Split), Platinum Dunes partners Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ouija series, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and DeMonaco’s longtime production partner, Sébastien K. Lemercier (Assault on Precinct 13, Four Lovers).  \n\nThe First Purge is directed by Gerard McMurray (Burning Sands), working from a screenplay once again written by DeMonaco.  www.thefirstpurge.com",4,4,7,26,18,1446544.0

Why isn’t ‘Off to the Vet’ available in full on YouTube? A. ‘Off to the Vet’ film production and crowdfunding campaign was a huge undertaking for the Simon’s Cat Team. Our hope is to produce more long form, full colour content for our fans but without having to turn to them through crowdfunding again. The film was completed in 2015 and submitted it to a selection of international film festivals over the following months. During this time, it was exclusively available to all funders that contributed via our private production blog. The feedback we have received from our funders has been overwhelming positive and we hope they are extremely proud of making the film a possibility. If you are a funder and have any questions regarding the campaign, please contact us at igg@simonscat.com\n\nQ. What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Even though the films are made on computer software, they are still hand-animated in a traditional manner, frame to frame. It usually takes between 12 and 25 drawings to create 1 second of a Simon's Cat film.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official web shop: \nhttp://www.shop.simonscat.com",6,6,488,1332,46,4673210.0

While Britain created the immortal Spitfire, Lancaster and Edgley Optica, it also created a wealth of dangerous, disgraceful and diabolical designs. These are just ten plucked from a shortlist of thirty.  In defining ‘worst’- we’ve looked for one, or a combination, of the following: design flaws, conceptual mistakes, being extremely dangerous, being unpleasant to fly, or obsolete at the point of service entry (and the type must have entered service). Grab a cup of tea, and prepare for ire as you read about ten machines they wanted your dad, grandad or great grandad to fly to war. I'd love to hear your opinions below.

Theresa and Tony Matthews had always loved wildlife but after being told that the healthy orphaned joey would have to be euthanised, they realised they had to aid the helpless animal and their kangaroo sanctuary was born. \n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Alana Tompson\nProducer: Hannah Stevens, Ruby Coote\nEditor: Thom Johnson\n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit ANIMALS.BARCROFT.TV: http://animals.barcroft.tv/\nLike @BarcroftAnimals on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftAnimals/\nFollow @BarcroftAnimals on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BarcroftAnimals\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/videos\n\nDownload the Barcroft TV iOS app: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&hl=en",4,6,158,447,23,414563.0

Jimmy agrees with Trump but in order to fix this SOMETHING has to be done. We need real laws that keep assault rifles out of the hands of people who are going to shoot our kids.

Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.",6,6,488,3338,31,13608050.0

Video game bad guy Ralph (voice of John C. Reilly) and fellow misfit Vanellope von Schweetz (voice of Sarah Silverman) must risk it all by traveling to the world wide web in search of a replacement part to save Vanellope’s video game, Sugar Rush. In way over their heads, Ralph and Vanellope rely on the citizens of the internet—the netizens—to help navigate their way, including a webite entrepreneur named Yesss (voice of Taraji P. Henson), who is the head algorithm and the heart and soul of trend-making site “BuzzzTube.” Directed by Rich Moore (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph”) and Phil Johnston (co-writer “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Cedar Rapids,” co-writer “Zootopia,”), and produced by Clark Spencer (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Bolt”), “Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-Ralph 2” hits theaters on Nov. 21, 2018.\n\nSee more from official Disney Animation:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneyanimation\n\nWelcome to the official Walt Disney Animation Studios YouTube channel!

Set during the final week of Jesus' life, the story is told from the perspective of infamous betrayer Judas Iscariot. As more and more followers flock to Jesus, Judas grows concerned that Jesus is becoming arrogant and losing sight of his principles. So when Jesus attacks the money changers in a temple, Judas finally turns on his teacher, setting both on a path to tragedy. Originally conceived as a concept album that hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts, the show eventually made its way to the stage in 1971 and garnered five Tony nominations in addition to winning a Drama Desk Award for Andrew Lloyd Webber. Now this globally celebrated classic comes to NBC in 2018 for a one-of-a-kind live staging on Easter Sunday that's sure to amaze with jaw-dropping spectacle, an all-star cast of beloved recording artists and a fresh soundtrack featuring such hits as Heaven on Their Minds, I Don't Know How to Love Him and Superstar.\n\nJesus Christ Superstar Live - John Legend Rehearses (Promo)\nhttps://youtu.be/-QR-TB_k20M\n\nNBC on YouTube\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc",1,6,441,1077,25,566908.0
